<h2>How to manage your files</h2>
<p>
In the files view you can see all files, which were uploaded to ERPAL. Every file is wrapped by a node that allows you to add meta data to you files. You can tag a file when you upload the file. You can filter those files with those tags or you search for the file directly. Clicking the title of the file will start the download. If you click the icon on the right side of the title, you will see the file details. 
In the detail view you can see to which content the file is attached to and you can also see the revisions of the file. 
Press CTRL+B will open a upload box on every page. You can just drag&drop you file to this box and it will be uploaded to ERPAL. You can use the box and drag&drop this box to any file field in datasets and comments.
