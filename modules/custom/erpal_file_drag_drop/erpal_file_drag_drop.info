It will also add drag&drop functionality to any form providing file field items. Currently only supported by WebKit browsers (like Chrome and Safari). When editing a node that references ERPAL Files you can use drag&drop for both the autocomplete widget (the block must be included in the page in this case) and the inline entitiy reference widget (block is not necessarily required then)."
