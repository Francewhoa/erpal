The SimpleTest Fixture module allows to use an existing 
database with Drupal configurations as fixture for testing 
(rather than the default SimpleTest behavior of building a 
test site up from install hooks).

The intention is to speed up the test cycle time by skipping 
the time-consuming process to build up test fixtures program-
matically.
